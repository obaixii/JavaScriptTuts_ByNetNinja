    <h4>Ternary Operator (Short Hand If...Else)</h4>
    <p>There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:</p>
    <p><strong>Syntex:</strong> variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
